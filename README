Gavim2 - Gaveen's Vim Configuration
===================================

This is the Vim configuration I actually use. It should be usable
in any decent Linux system.


How to install (on Linux)
-------------------------
1. Clone this repository
2. In the cloned directory run:
   $ git submodule init && git submodule update
3. Delete conflicting snippets by running:
   $ rm -rf ./vim/bundle/plugin-snipmate/snippets
4. Link (Eg: using ln -s) the following files:
  4.1 vim/ as ~/.vim
  4.2 vimrc as ~/.vimrc


How to update (on Linux)
------------------------
1. In the cloned directory run:
   $ git pull && git submodule update


Dependencies
------------
Having the following ready in your system should ensure a smooth
experience. Lack of them would *not* break vim though. You can
pick what you want to use.

  # vim and/or gvim - at least try to use version 7.2 or above.
    Package: Fedora family => vim-enhanced / vim-X11,
             Debian family => vim (not default) / vim-gnome
  # git - to clone and update this repository and submodules
    Package: Fedora family => git, Debian family => git-core
  # ack - a better grep alternative if you plan to use :Ack
    Package: Fedora family => ack, Debian family => ack-grep
      if you use a Debian family OS, uncomment necessary line in vimrc
  # python - if you plan to use the Conque Terminal i.e., <leader>t
    Package: Fedora family => python, Debian family => python
  # vim-latex - Vim LaTeX Suite plugin to use vim as a LaTeX/TeX IDE
    Package: Fedora family => vim-latex, Debian family => vim-latexsuite


Plugins
-------
These are the plugins I've included in this set of files.
  - ack (pattern matching) - :Ack pattern optional_path
  - auto-pairs (auto-complete matching pairs) - <F3> to toggle
  - bufexploreer (buffer explorer) - <leader>bb
  - conque (embedded terminal) - <leader>t
  - csapprox (use GUI colorchemes in terminal)
  - fugitive (Git wrapper)
  - gitv (gitk/gitg-like git commit viewer for fugitive)
  - matchit (pair matching) - %
  - nerdcommenter (commenting) - <leader>c<space>
  - nerdtree (file browser) - <leader>d
  - pandoc (nice pandoc editing experience)
  - pathogen (plugin bundle handling)
  - rails (for Ruby on Rails)
  - ruby-refactoring (for Ruby)
  - scratch (temporary buffer) - <leader>s
  - snipmate (snippets)
  - vcscommand (generic VCS frontend)


Newer Vim setups already have some great features like spell checking,
word completion, code folding, etc. A load of colorchemes are also
included (both light and dark themes) to choose from.

NOTE: railscasts-nm colorscheme works well with transparent terminals.

Credit should go to everyone who brought you vim, plugins, related
tools, documentation, provide help and more. Also a big thank you to
official vim docs, Vim Tips Wiki and #vim channel.
