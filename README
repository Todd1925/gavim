Gavim2 - Gaveen's Vim Configuration v 2.0
=========================================

This is the Vim configuration I actually use. I will try to keep
this repository up-to-date.

How to install (on Linux)
-------------------------
1. Clone this repo
2. Open a command line in the repo directory
3. $ git submodule init
4. $ git submodule update
5. Delete the directory ./vim/bundle/snipmate/snippets
6. Link (Eg: using ln -s) the following
  6.1 gvimrc as ~/.gvimrc
  6.2 vimrc as ~/.vimrc
  6.3 vim/ as ~/.vim


How to update (on Linux)
------------------------
If you want to update to the latest from my repository.
1. Change into the cloned repos directory (i.e., use 'cd' command)
2. $ git pull
3. $ git submodule update
4. Delete the directory ./vim/bundle/snipmate/snippets if it exists

I'm too lazy to write a script for the above tasks. May be later.


Dependencies
------------
Having the following programs installed & ready to use should ensure
a smooth experience. Lack of them would *not* break vim though. I am
listing their purpose here so that you may opt not to use them.

  # vim and/or gvim - at least try to use version 7.2 or above.
      version 7.3 compiled with +ruby to use relativenumber
    Package: Fedora family => vim-enhanced / vim-X11,
             Debian family => vim (not default) / vim-gnome
  # git - to clone and update this repository and submodules
    Package: Fedora family => git, Debian family => git-core
  # ack - a better grep alternative if you plan to use :Ack
    Package: Fedora family => ack, Debian family => ack-grep
      if you use a Debian family OS, uncomment necessary line in vimrc
  # python - if you plan to use the Conque Terminal i.e., <leader>t
    Package: Fedora family => python, Debian family => python
  # vim-latex - Vim LaTeX Suite plugin to use vim as a LaTeX/TeX IDE
    Package: Fedora family => vim-latex, Debian family => vim-latexsuite


Plugins
-------
These are the plugins I've included in this set of files.
  - ack.vim (pattern matching) - :Ack pattern optional_path
  - bufexploreer (buffer explorer) - <leader>bb
  - conque (embedded terminal) - <leader>t
  - matchit (pair matching)
  - nerdcommenter (commenting) - <leader>c<space>
  - nerdtree (file browser) - <leader>d
  - pathogen (plugin bundle handling)
  - scratch (temporary buffer) - <leader>s
  - snipmate (snippets)
  - rails (for Ruby on Rails)
  - vcscommand (generic VCS frontend)
  - fugitive (Git wrapper)
  - guicolorscheme (use GUI colorchemes in console)


Vim 7.2 (or higher) already have some great additional features like spell
checking, word completion, code folding, etc. A load colorchemes are also
included (both light and dark themes) to choose from.
