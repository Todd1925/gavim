Gavim2 - Gaveen's Vim Configuration v 2.0
===========================================

This is the Vim configuration I actually use. If you are somehow using my
older Vim configuration from http://github.com/gaveen/gavim I suggest you
switched to this. This version is much more organized. I don't think I'll
be maintaining or using the old one anymore. And oh, by the way I mostly
use gVim/vim-X11 these days.


How to install (on Linux)
--------------------------
1. Clone this repo
2. Open a command line in the repo directory
3. $ git submodule init
4. $ git submodule update
5. Delete the directory ./vim/bundle/snipmate/snippets
6. Link the following
	6.1 gvimrc as ~/.gvimrc
	6.2 vimrc as ~/.vimrc
	6.3 vim/ as ~/.vim

I'm too lazy to write an installer script for the above. May be later.
 


Since I work most of the time in an up to date Fedora (Linux) system, I took
the liberty of taking some parts of my .vimrc directly from the very decent
default Vim configuration found in a Fedora (10) system. The rest filled,
tuned and tweaked until it felt right.

Most of the plugins are added as git submodules and all of the plugins are
kept separately as bundles things to Tim Pope's awesome vim-pathogen plugin.
Since I removed a lot of cruft from the original version and added a couple
of neat things, there's bound to be more dependencies. On the plus side it's
much much more convenient with the set of things I use.


Dependencies
-------------
My Vim configuration assumes the following programs are installed in your
system and are ready to be used.
  # ack - the better grep if you plan to use :Ack
	(Debian/Ubuntu people need ack-grep package and also set the proper
	 value for in vimrc. Eg: let g:ackprg="ack -H --nocolor --nogroup" )
  # python - if you plan to use the Conque Terminal i.e., <leader>t
  # vim-latex - Vim LaTeX Suite plugin http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/
	if you plan to do a lot of LaTeX/TeX work, this is simply great. The
	configuration is already done in vimrc.
  # git - and finally if you want to grab and use my vimfiles and update it
	you will need git.



Plugins
--------
These are the plugins I've included in this set of files.
  - ack.vim (pattern matching) - :Ack pattern optional_path
  - bufexploreer (buffer explorer) - <leader>be
  - conque (embedded terminal) - <leader>t
  - matchit (pair matching)
  - nerdcommenter (commenting)
  - nerdtree (file browser) - <leader>d
  - pathogen (plugin bundle handling)
  - scratch (temporary buffer)
  - snipmate (snippets)
  - rails (for Ruby on Rails)
  - vcscommand (generic VCS frontend)
  - fugitive (Git wrapper)


Vim 7.2 already has some great additional features like spell checking, word
completion, code folding, etc. I'm only interested in maintaining this
configuration for the Vim version I'm using, which happened to be 7.2 as of
this writing.

A few colorchemes are included, where some of them are directly from the
default vim installation in Fedora. To get the best view of the color schemes
t_Co=256 is set by default in the .vimrc file.


Thanks goes to many many Vim users for making the plugins, snippets, syntax,
etc. files and also for making their Vim configuration public so that I could
learn from them. That's all for now.
