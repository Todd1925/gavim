Gavim2 - Gaveen's Vim Configuration v 2.0
=========================================

This is the Vim configuration I actually use. If you are somehow using my
older Vim configuration from http://github.com/gaveen/gavim I suggest you
switch to this. This version is much more organized. I won't be maintaining
or using the old one anymore.

I recommend using gvim/vim-X11/vim-gnome/etc. But it's not a must.


How to install (on Linux)
-------------------------
1. Clone this repo
2. Open a command line in the repo directory
3. $ git submodule init
4. $ git submodule update
5. Delete the directory ./vim/bundle/snipmate/snippets
6. Link the following
	6.1 gvimrc as ~/.gvimrc
	6.2 vimrc as ~/.vimrc
	6.3 vim/ as ~/.vim


How to update (on Linux)
------------------------
1. Change into the cloned repos directory (i.e., use 'cd' command)
2. $ git pull
3. $ git submodule update

I'm too lazy to write a script for the above tasks. May be later.


Since I work most of the time in an up to date Fedora (Linux) system, I took
the liberty of taking some parts of my .vimrc directly from the very decent
default Vim configuration found in a Fedora (10) system. The rest I filled,
tuned and tweaked until it felt right.

Most of the plugins are added as git submodules (which aren't have a version
number in the bundle name) and all of the plugins are kept separately as
bundles by using Tim Pope's awesome vim-pathogen plugin.

Since I removed a lot of cruft from the original version of gavim, added a
couple of neat things and tuned some more, there's bound to be more
dependencies. On the plus side this version is much much more convenient to
setup and use for stuff I do.


Dependencies
------------
My Vim configuration assumes the following programs are installed in your
system and are ready to be used.
  # ack - the better grep (if you plan to use :Ack)
	(Debian/Ubuntu people need ack-grep package and also to set the proper
	 value in vimrc. Eg: let g:ackprg="ack-grep -H --nocolor --nogroup" )
  # python - if you plan to use the Conque Terminal i.e., <leader>t
  # vim-latex - Vim LaTeX Suite plugin http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/
	if you plan to do a lot of LaTeX/TeX work, this is simply great. The
	configuration is already done in vimrc.
  # git - and finally if you want to grab and use my vimfiles and update it
	you will need git.
  # vim version at least 7.3 compiled with +ruby if you want to use relative
	line numbering (i.e., set relativenumber)


Plugins
-------
These are the plugins I've included in this set of files.
  - ack.vim (pattern matching) - :Ack pattern optional_path
  - bufexploreer (buffer explorer) - <leader>be
  - conque (embedded terminal) - <leader>t
  - matchit (pair matching)
  - nerdcommenter (commenting) - <leader>c<space>
  - nerdtree (file browser) - <leader>d
  - pathogen (plugin bundle handling)
  - scratch (temporary buffer) - <leader>s
  - snipmate (snippets)
  - rails (for Ruby on Rails)
  - vcscommand (generic VCS frontend)
  - fugitive (Git wrapper)
  - guicolorscheme (use GUI colorchemes in console)


Vim 7.2 (or higher) already have some great additional features like spell
checking, word completion, code folding, etc. I'm only interested in
maintaining this configuration for the Vim version I'm using, which happened
to be 7.2 as of this writing.

A few colorchemes are also included. Some of them were directly taken from the
default vim installation in Fedora. To get the best view of the color schemes
t_Co=256 is set by default in the .vimrc file.


Thanks go to many many Vim users for sharing the plugins, snippets, syntax,
etc. files and also for making their Vim configuration public so that others
could learn from them.

Free vim tip: <Ctrl-r>+ in insert mode will paste from the OS clipboard.
